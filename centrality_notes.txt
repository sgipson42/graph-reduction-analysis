# CENTRALITY
# Centralization measures the extent to which the ties of a given network are concentrated on a single actor or group of actors. 
# IN removing nodes from a graph, if you only want to keep important nodes in a graph, you need to define what counts as "an important node" in the context of your problem. In terms of a social network, important nodes can have many connections, control the flow of information, 
#  Eigenvector Centrality

"""
Degree centrality only takes into account the number of edges for each node, but it leaves out information about egoâ€™s alters.

However, we might think that power comes from being tied to powerful people. If A and B have the same degree centrality, but A is tied to all high degree people and B is tied to all low degree people, then intuitively we want to see A with a higher score than B.

Closeness might undervalue nodes that are influential but not central to the network (closeness emphasizes who can efficiently disseminate info)

Each centrality measure provides complementary insights:

Degree centrality shows local popularity or activity.
Closeness centrality identifies global accessibility or efficiency in reaching others.
Betweenness centrality reveals structural importance as connectors or brokers.
Analyzing all three measures together would offer a comprehensive view of influence, communication dynamics, and roles within the Congressional Twitter interaction network.

#	influential nodes in a social network
# TODO: degree centrality
#	assumes important nodes have many connections
#	measures involvement of the node in the network
# 	advantage: only the local structure around a node must be known for it to be calculated
#	disadvantage:  does not take into consideration the global structure of the network. For example, although a node might be connected to many others, it might not be in a position to reach others quickly to access resources, such as information or knowledge

# TODO: closeness centrality
#	assumes important nodes are close to other nodes

# TODO: betweenness centrality
#	assumes important nodes connect other nodes
#	 assess the degree to which a node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes, and are able to funnel the flow in the network. In so doing, a node can assert control over the flow
# degree, closeness and betweenness are the three formalized measures
#Degree centrality shows people with many social connections. Closeness centrality indicates who is at the heart of a social network. Betweenness centrality describes people who connect social circles. Eigenvector centrality is high among influential people in the network.
